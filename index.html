            <p>My name is Tristyn, but I'm called by a different name by everyone I know, (i.e. TK, Teeks, Tessa, etc.)
            </p>
            <p>I have four cats (always room for more!), know an endless amount of useless animal facts that no one
                asked to hear, and spent around $14,000 on my higher education just to be like Neo from the Matrix.
            </p>
            <p>I have no valuable skills or talents, and one of those include Graphic Design. I am also passionate
                about-but still not good
                at: arcade style combat games, DDR, and anything else that requires hand/eye coordination with lots of
                flashing lights.</p>
            <p>Besides animals and video games, I also absolutely loose it over Mechas and Robots, Kaijus, and any
                cyberpunk style literature and bingable content.</p>

    <p>My name is Tristyn, but I'm called by a different name by everyone I know, (i.e. Tris (do NOT call me that-I will FIND you and I will END you), TK, Teeks, etc.</p>
    <p>I have four cats (always room for more!), have and endless amounts of useless animal facts that no one asked to hear at my disposal, and spent around $14,000 on my higher education just to be like Neo from the Matrix.</p>
    <p>I have no talents and one of those include Graphic Design. I am also passionate about but still not good at: arcade style combat games, DDR, & and anything else that requires hand/eye coordination.</p>
    <p>Besides animals and video games, I also absolutely loose it over mechas and Kaijus, and any cyberpunk style literature and bingable content.</p>
